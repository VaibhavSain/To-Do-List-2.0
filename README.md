Project Alert: To-Do List with Local Storage Feature using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Project Overview: I am excited to announce the completion of a dynamic To-Do List application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with an added feature of Local Storage. This feature ensures that the user's to-do items persist across browser sessions, allowing for a seamless and consistent user experience.

Key Features:

    User Interface: The To-Do List has a clean and intuitive design built using HTML and styled with CSS. It is responsive, ensuring smooth operation across different screen sizes.

    Add, Edit, and Delete Tasks: Users can add new tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them as needed. Tasks are displayed in a user-friendly list format.

    Local Storage Integration: Tasks are stored in the browserâ€™s Local Storage. This ensures that even after the page is reloaded or the browser is closed and reopened, the tasks remain intact, providing a persistent experience.

    JavaScript Functionality: The core functionality of adding, editing, and deleting tasks is handled by JavaScript. The application updates the list dynamically without needing to reload the page.

Technology Stack:

    HTML: To structure the content of the To-Do List.
    CSS: To design and style the user interface, making it visually appealing and responsive.
    JavaScript: To handle the logic behind adding, editing, deleting, and storing tasks in Local Storage.

Why Local Storage? The use of Local Storage helps in keeping the tasks saved locally on the user's browser, meaning no server-side storage is needed. This provides a lightweight and efficient solution for retaining user data across different sessions. Users will not lose their to-do list items unless they manually clear their browser storage.
